# ActionScript Off-by-One Array Access Bug

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error when accessing elements in an ActionScript array.  The `bug.as` file contains code that attempts to access an element outside the bounds of the array, leading to `undefined` being returned.

The `bugSolution.as` file provides a corrected version of the code that accurately accesses the desired array element.
